## Dear, Customers of Imagineee

A notice for customers that have websites made by [Imagineee](https://imagineeeinc.github.io/).
Your website will be migrating to a different website developer, designer, hosting and provider.
But, don't panic its not moving to a different developer. [Imagineee](https://imagineeeinc.github.io/), your previous provider, is the CEO of WeHost.

### WeHost?
WeHost is the new Website developer that will get your idea to deployment quick and easy. This has been done to simplify management of clients.

### So, what happens to your website?
Well it will stay exactly the same, same domain and same Developer.

### The Future of your website? And other perks for customers?
Your website will probably be getting a domain update. From: 'soandso.github.io' or 'soandso.glitch.me' to: 'soandso.web.app'. This will probably be happening in the future.

### Support
If you want to get any extra features or change anything, please get in touch your preferred communication method.

### Thanks, I hope you have a good experiance.

**Yours, [Imagineee](https://imagineeeinc.github.io/)**
